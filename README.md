# Stations
### Check out the site here: https://pizzashi.github.io/stations-deployment/

The site is optimized to work on 1366x768; it is definitely not mobile friendly. The newer browser versions also blocked autoplaying music (which is a good thing), so the background music must be played manually, which is found in the site settings (in the **Info** tab).

This website was made for compliance with a junior high school project.

The code is really untidy and deprecated.

This project needs a major makeover, but it was really really fun making this back then.
